A simple CCLoader-compatible mod to allow to add more locales/translations.

You will need another mod to provide the locale that you want.

Installation:
- If not already done, install CCLoader or CCInjector
- Just copy these files in a subdirectory of assets/mods/
- Install the locale/translation mod that you want to use
- Launch the game and look in the language settings, the locale mod
  that you installed should appear, and can be selected like any
  other language.  Restart the game as instructed.

Uninstallation:
- Just remove the files. Your saves should revert to english if they were
  on a custom locale.

This mod currently handles the following:
- Adding more languages in the option menu
- Loading translations and inserting them into the game
- Optionally patching the PNG fonts to add more characters or improve them.
- Preliminary support for changing the way the game format numbers.

For details on how to create a translation mod, see the Documentation.md file.

A simple CCLoader-compatible mod to allow to add more locales/translations.

You will need another mod to provide the locale that you want.

Once locales are installed, they can be selected by changing the
language in the options.  Uninstalling this mod should be safe.

This mod currently handles the following :
- Adding more languages in the option menu
- Loading translations and inserting them into the game
- Optionally patching the PNG fonts to add more characters or improve them.

To create, modify or update translations, check out Localize-Me-Tools

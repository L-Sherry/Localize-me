A simple CCLoader-compatible mod to allow to add more locales/translations.

You will need another mod to provide the locale that you want.

Once locales are installed, they can be selected by changing the
language in the options.

We cannot guarantee that the original program will revert to a known locale
after removing this mod, so switch back to english before removing this.

This software is licensed under the MIT license. However, please check that
your local judiriction does not restrict the use of such software.
